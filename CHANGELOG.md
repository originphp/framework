## [2.0.0] - 2019-10-25

Releasing version 2.0, see the [upgrade guide](https://www.originphp.com/docs/upgrade) for information on how to upgrade from previous versions.

There is an [upgrade tool](https://github.com/originphp/upgrade) which can handle moving and renaming and alerting to items that might need changing.

### Version 2

Summary of what has changed:

1. Removed deprecated features and no longer needed or duplicate features

2. Changed application folder a structure to a more organized way which makes it easier to work with given the number of folders that are now used. This affects Controllers, Middleware, Views and Mailers. see the [upgrade guide](http://localhost:8080/docs/upgrade) for more information on the folder structure.

3. Changed how some features work
    - changed how callbacks work in Controllers and Models, callbacks are now registered.
    - changed Middleware callbacks and design
    - Migrations store version in db as biginteger

4. Added strict types,return types any public properties have been changed to protected

5. Added some new features like custom Entity classes with mutators and accessors

6. Deocupled the framework into separate packages. The rest of the framework, Console/Http/Model/Mailer/Job etc stays as one but maybe in future will have split readonly repos using /splitsh.

7. Changed the bootstrap process, this means less magic under the hood and more flexability. For example, plugins can now be standlone applications.

I have been working full time on the framework to get this where it is now, changes going forward from here should be slow, with a focus on improving code base, developing and testing with future PHP versions, bug and security fixes.

### Added

- Custom Entity classes, with mutators and accessors
